# Number-guessing-game
In the number guessing game, one player thinks of a secret number within a specified range, and the other player tries to guess that number by asking a series of questions. The player who knows the secret number responds with clues or answers based on the questions asked.
One player, known as the "thinker" or "chooser," decides on a secret number without revealing it to the other player. The number can be any whole number within a predetermined range.

The other player, known as the "guesser," starts the game by making the first guess. They can choose any number within the specified range.

The thinker responds to the guess with clues or answers to help the guesser narrow down the possibilities. The typical responses are:

If the guess is correct, the game ends, and the guesser wins.
If the guess is too high, the thinker says "lower" or "too high."
If the guess is too low, the thinker says "higher" or "too low."
Based on the clue given by the thinker, the guesser adjusts their strategy and makes another guess. This process continues until the guesser correctly guesses the secret number.

The goal of the game is for the guesser to find the secret number using the fewest possible guesses. It requires logical thinking, deduction, and strategy to narrow down the range of possible numbers and make educated guesses.
